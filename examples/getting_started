Sample Project #1 (log processing)

Take the data defined in input.sql, add it to a SortaSQL DB, then query the data.

1) Compile and install the code as shown in the README file. You will first want to look in common.h, setting file paths.
You should now have the library pg_kc.so installed 

2) In Postgres, run the files pg_kc.sql and helper.sql. Make sure that you don't get any errors.
You should now have a number of functions definined in Postgres, including get_page_views(). Look at the definition of this function (in helper.sql) to get a sense of how to access data.

3) Compile import_data.cc
g++ import_data.cc -o import_data ../cpp/entry.pb.cc -I../ -ljson_linux-gcc-4.4.4_libmt -lboost_iostreams -lpcrecpp -lkyotocabinet -lprotobuf

This program takes data in a Postgres COPY statement and adds it to a SortaSQL DB.

You will need to have installed 
* http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
* boost iostreams
* pcrecpp

Adjust the config directives in importer.json to make sense, making sure the directories listed exist.

Import the data:

./import_data example.sql

This will output a file which needs to be loaded in Postgres while populating the proper KC DBs.
The PG file will now just have the metadata needed for accessing these KC DBs.
Load this file into Postgres.

Finally, access the data. For example, to get the number of page views for the zone -99999 in the last 1000000 hours, try:

select * from get_page_views(1000000, -99999);

To make custom functions, study the definition of the function get_page_views in helper.sql.

Features which need to be worked on:

* Working symetrical functions to support the PG callback functions input, output, receive, send.

Right now all input runs via the bulk uploader. It would be good to enable adding data via the PG interface. 
This includes the text based input/output functions (symetrical here means that output from output() can be fed right back to input()),
and their binary equivalents recieve/send.

* Support for INSERT, UPDATE statements.

* Smarter sharding/replication layer, moving data at the KC/PG level across boxes rather than at the user level.

* Possible integration with a caching filesystem (http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/CacheFS) to imporve performance.

* More examples.
